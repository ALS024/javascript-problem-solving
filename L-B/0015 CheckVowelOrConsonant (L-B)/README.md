# Problem 15 (L-B) ~ Check Vowel or Consonant

## Problem

This program takes an *English* alphabet and informs the user if the given alphabet is a vowel or a constant.

### Vowels

A vowel is a letter that represents an open sound. When we make a vowel sound, we don't obstruct the airflow with the lips or tongue. In the English alphabet, there are five vowels and they are: **a**, **e**, **i**, **o**, and **u**.

### Consonants

In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract.
Examples of consonants are:  **Z**, **B**, **T**, **G**, and **H**.
