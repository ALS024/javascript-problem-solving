# Quadratic Equation Solver

Given a Quadratic Equation
$$ ax^2+bx+c=0 $$

We wish to find the solutions for __x__.
We derive the quadratic formula from the equation above.
$$ x = -b \pm \sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a $$

Break it down to two solutions

$$ x1 = -b + \sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a $$

$$ x1 = -b - \sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a $$

## Example

Given
$$ x^2+8x+15=0 $$
$$ a = 1, b = 8, c = 15 $$

---

Solution
$$ x1 = -8 + \sqrt(8^2 - 4*1*15) / 2*1 $$
$$ x1 = -3 $$

$$ x1 = -8 - \sqrt(8^2 - 4*1*15) / 2*1 $$
$$ x1 = -5 $$
